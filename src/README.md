# PDF Content Extraction Using Adobe Extract API

## Folder Contents
This folder will start off empty, except for this README file. The spider will 
first download the PDF files it finds in to this folder before the rest of the 
process begins extracting and creating files. A short overview of the folders 
contents when the process is complete is available below.

- `confidence-check`
